@0    = ~Why hello, <CHARNAME>, so glad to see you. Now I would like to thank you for eliminating Sir Jones and those loyal to him. He was in my way of taking over Oversight and the Sections. A shame you had to destroy Section One, they were the best at what they did.~
@1    = ~Don't thank me too soon, your reign will be short after I get done with you.~
@2    = ~You can thank me by explaining why I have been hunted down like an animal by your group.~
@3    = ~Oh is that a fact? I hope you can back up that idle threat.~
@4    = ~Its nothing personal after all, we accepted a contract by an individual named Koveras. Speaking of this contract, we do have to fullfill it even after you helped me out in removing people in my way. Men, cancel them immediatly!~
