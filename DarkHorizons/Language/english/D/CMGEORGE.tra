@0 = ~If I may interrupt Sir Jones. This is <CHARNAME> and group, the one and only who destroyed Section.~
@1 = ~Sir your squire Tildus was supposed to have reported this information to you. Why he did not report this I do not know. Perhaps the last bringer of ill tidings met with a fatal ending and he did not want that to happen to him. We can deal with him later Sir Jones, right now we have these foul evil doers in our midst and by the grace of Torm they must be cancelled. Our associates in the Iron Throne hired Section to deal with this monster.~
@2 = ~If I may say something about this Sir Jones, <CHARNAME> is the offspring of the dead *evil* god Bhaal, thus making it evil. Plus <CHARNAME> has been raiding and burning villages on <PRO_HISHER> way here. <PRO_HESHE> has been killing and slaughtering people including children who were sacrificed to Bhaal. <CHARNAME> even killed your "friend" Najara.~
@3 = ~Lies! I had to kill Najara in defense because she attacked me but I did none of the other things he says!~
@4 = ~Bleet on dead because your end is at hand. Come Sir Jones we must put an end to this evil once and for all! <PRO_HESHE> killed Najara in cold blood. Revenge yes!~
@5 = ~Yes kill them all! I on the other hand will see to it that our gold is well protected.~
