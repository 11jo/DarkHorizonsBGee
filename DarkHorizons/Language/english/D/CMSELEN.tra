@0    = ~Hail traveler! My name is Selene and I carry a warning if you go deeper into the Cloakwood. There is a foul dragon here, it has chased us out of our grove. If you have the courage and desire a great reward, destroy this foul beast from our woods. It was last seen by the cliffs overlooking the sea. Oh yes, bring me its head to show the proof of the deed.~
@1    = ~A druid named Selene warned us about a dragon in Cloakwood. Great rewards await us if we kill it for her.~
@2    = ~You return and you have the head of that vile affront to nature. Please, let me give you this ring to keep you safe in your travels.~
@3    = ~We destroyed the dragon for Selene's group of druids. She gave us a nice ring that I can put to good use during my adventures.~
@4    = ~You return and you have the head of that vile affront to nature. Please, let me give you this ring to keep you safe in your travels. Thank you and may Silvanus bless you.~
