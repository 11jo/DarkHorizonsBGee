@0    = ~Well what do we have here? Common vagabonds have infiltrated our estate. This is quite troubling. What is the meaning of this, George?~
@1    = ~Our security has become lax of late. We will have to cancel the head of security for this. It appears that this is the band of misfits that had destroyed Section, my lord.~
@2    = ~This is them? How, how is this possible? No one knows of this place but a selected few.~
@3    = ~My lord, they are here and how they got here is not the issue right now. We really need to get the guards up here to deal with them.~
@4    = ~Ah yes of course. Guards, send these vagabonds into the black at once!~
@5    = ~This is my time to exit this scene. I will see to the security of the gold in the dungeon, Sir Jones.~
@6    = ~What? You will stay and defend!~
@7    = ~Sorry, my lord, I can't hear you. Good bye.~
@8    = ~I'll deal with you later. As for you, guards, kill the intruder!~
