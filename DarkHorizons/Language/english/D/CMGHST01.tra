@0    = ~You dare invade our sanctum? Leave now! Leave!~
@1    = ~Leave? We just got here. Looks like there's a lot of treasure to plunder.~
@2    = ~Undead spirits! Good! We came here to smite your evil kind!~
@3    = ~I may leave if you answer my questions first. Why are you still here haunting this place?~
@4    = ~Thieves! You will not live to see daylight again! Kill them, kill them all!~
@5    = ~Your bones will serve us well as guardians to our tombs. Slay them all!~
@6    = ~Why? Why you ask? We were needlessly attacked by cowards who thought of us as a threat and sought to steal our knowledge. For this we remain and our dead enemies we cursed them to serve us as protectors of our knowledge. Ironic isn't it? What they came to steal, they now end up protecting as will you. You will never leave here, destroy them!~
