@0    = ~You're at the end of your rope, I'll wager. Not that it's anything personal, you understand, but I'm afraid your time here is just about done. They sent me a message that your time was up, and so it shall be.~
@1    = ~Why are you doing this? I've done nothing to you.~
@2    = ~Whatever you're being paid, I'll double it.~
@3    = ~I hope you've the will to back up those words.~
@4    = ~You've done nothing to anyone, far as I know. Don't matter one whit to me. A price is a price and a head is a head, and whenever the two meet, there's myself making my living. Like I said, it's nothing personal.~
@5    = ~Will you now? Somehow I doubt it, but then I don't meet a lot of honest people in this business. Never have the money on them, and never come back if they say their going to go get it. It doesn't matter though. I'd never take your panic money over a proven contract. It's just not sound business.~
@6    = ~Aye, that I do.  The will AND the way.  Shall we get to business then?~
