@0 = ~Ygrainne, do you see who is approaching us? It looks like that <CHARNAME> person we are looking for.~
@1 = ~I believe so judging by their appreance. They look worse than the beggers on the streets.~
@2 = ~Probably not much of a challenge either. I was so hoping to put my fighting skills to the test.~
@3 = ~Perhaps have your guards dispatch them? Even they could handle this riff raff.~
@4 = ~I suppose I could do that, but I would have to give them the reward money.~
@5 = ~As if you need more coin, my dear. Being of royalty has its privileges like wealth and allowing others to get their hands dirty instead of you.~
@6 = ~Quite right about that, my love. Men, kill this person of evil and take their head, you will need it as proof for the reward.~
